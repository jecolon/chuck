# chuck
An Internet Chuck Norris DB client in Go

## Usage
```bash
chuck [-n]
  -n Only nerdy Chuck Norris jokes.
```

## Disclaimer
This client only retrieves a single random joke, optionally filtering to only nerdy
jokes. The full icndb.com API allows other interesting options, but I kept it simple
for the moment.
